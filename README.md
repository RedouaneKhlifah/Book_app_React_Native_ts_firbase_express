dotenv: A zero-dependency module for loading environment variables from a .env file.
Development Dependencies

typescript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
eslint: A pluggable linting utility for JavaScript and TypeScript.
nodemon: A utility that monitors changes in files and automatically restarts the server.
concurrently: A utility for running multiple commands concurrently.
@types/: TypeScript type definitions for various modules used in the project.
